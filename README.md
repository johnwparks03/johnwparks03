### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm currently a third year student at the University of Cincinnati studying computer science. One area I am interested in currently is anythign that involves artificial intelligence. I'm currently reading a book about learning computer vision using Tensorflow. In the future I hope to participate in machine learning projects!
